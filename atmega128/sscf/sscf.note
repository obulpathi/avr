page 41 .. theres a note .. 
Oscillator Calibration Register
â€“ OSCCAL
watch it ... i dunno whast it is ...
page 43 ... XDIV .. is the register we are interested in ... ;) 

fclk = source_clk / ( 129 - div );

source = 1 MHz
f	-	xdiv
10KHz 	- 	29
20KHz 	- 	79
33KHz	-	99
50KHz	-	109
100KHz	-	119
200KHz	-	124
333KHz	-	126
500KHz	-	127
1MHz	-	disable.

Readings obtained are as follows ... from 10KHz to 1MHz.
The readings won't change as expected from 500KHz to 1MHz ... actually the clk frequency is 1MHz ... so software frequency selection is disabled at this frequency ... due to this ... the reading does not change as expected.
and another thing is ... I noted the reading down to 3 rd digit after decimal ... but the last digit ( 3 rd digit after decimal kept changing by two / three units .... for example the first reading was observed as 0.484 or 0.483 or 0.485 ... )
