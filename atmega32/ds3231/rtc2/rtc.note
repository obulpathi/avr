interface  for RTC:
	RTC_Start(); starts timer ...
	RTC_Stop();
	RTC_GetSec();
	and the list goes on ...

Its better to use only one interrupt ... coz that lends easy in making of the software ... 
There is a buffer ... right??? yes that buffer is for storing the data values temporarly and then ...
My doubt is ... while changing time ... is there a possibility of interrupt being generated????? 

Finalized : 
	We will be using only one interrupt. That makes life more easier.
	However we will not be mis manupulating the interrupt2 ... NOTE this strongly ... 
	We are assuming that malfunctioned interrupts will not happen while setting the time.
	However, to be on safe-side we will disable the interrupt functionality in order to be on the safe side.

NOTE : For intercompatibility and reasons ... its planned to use"UTC" time format. 
So all things should be notified in this format.
// make the functions efficient ... time delays ... minimize them ... 
// where should I deintialize the ports ... i mean twi ports and stuff ???? >>>>>>>>>>
// also take care of sync and always keep in mind : INTERRUPTS ...
// think abt a mechanism by which you can make sure that diffrential delay will be minimized ... kind of running only this
// thread and suspending others ... disablin ghte interrupts ... that will make sure that diff time is minimum.
// interrupt is set ... interrupt occurs ... its cleared ... is there a possibility of it being set again???
// if so how much time will it take????
// it is heavily advised that user should diasble interrupts along with clearing it ...

// base functions start
// reads a register
