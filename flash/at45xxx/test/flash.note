thats good buddy k. 
define two things ...
	BOOLEAN formats TRUE and FALSE
	TRUE = 0;
	FLASE = error code ...
	nice naa ... ok

compare buffer functions ... check for correctness ...
df command to know the space left ... number of pages ... ??? good k

and make a full system ... 
debugging this stuff is not that easy ... one should have programmer and leds and flash connected together ...
connected in a flexible way ... got it ... think of it ...k

you are not connecting the reset and write protect pins ...
k this might be the cause for error ...
might be check this one too k...
but the default state is high ... they are internally pulled high ... k thats good ...

however connect the reset and write protect pins by delault to high ... thats better ... k

in the address bits check for reserverd bits ... (some four bits for upward compatiability)
ok ...

go through the algorithams and cross verify them with your program pseudo code ... k

also implement the SPI_Close() : (parallel to de init program) : for reallocating the ports safely and reducing the power
supply ...

flash uses DONTCARE and spi uses DUMMY ok ...
