 * \brief  XMEGA AES driver example source.
 *
 *      This file contains an example application that demonstrates the AES
 *      driver using polled functions. Both single AES and Cipher Block Chaining
 *      AES encyption and decryption is done.
 *
 * \par Application note:
 *      AVR1318 Using the XMEGA built in AES accelerator
 *
 * \par Documentation
 *      For comprehensive code documentation, supported compilers, compiler
 *      settings and supported devices see readme.html
