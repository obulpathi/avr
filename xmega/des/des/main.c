 * \brief  XMEGA DES driver example source.
 *
 *      This file contains an example application that demonstrates the DES
 *      driver. It shows how to do a DES encryption and decryption, a 3DES
 *      encryption and decryption and a DES cipher block chaining encryption and
 *      decryption. It can be used with both the driver optimized for speed and
 *      the driver optimized for size.
 *
 * \par Application note:
 *      AVR1317: Using the XMEGA built in DES accelerator
 *
 * \par Documentation
 *      For comprehensive code documentation, supported compilers, compiler
 *      settings and supported devices see readme.html
