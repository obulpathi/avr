 *  to make the quadrature decoder work. The example use the event system and
 *  a Timer/Counter to decode the signals and the counter value in the
 *  Timer/Counter will reflect the angle of rotation. The direction bit in the
 *  TC reflect the current direction of rotation.
 *
 *  Hardware setup:
 *   - PD0 - QDPH0
 *   - PD1 - QDPH90
 *   - PD2 - QDINDX
 *
 *  Peripherals used:
 *   - PORTD[2:0] signal input.
 *   - Event channel 0: quadrature signal.
 *   - Event channel 1: index signal.
 *   - TCC0: Quadrature counter.
