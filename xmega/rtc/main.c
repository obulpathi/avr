/*! \brief The main RTC example.
 *
 *  This function demonstrates how the RTC can be used to implement a simple
 *  second counter. The RTC is configured to produce an interrupt once every
 *  second. The RTC overflow interrupt keeps track of time by increasing a
 *  counter each time it is run. The time is shown in binary coded decimal,
 *  using 7 LEDs. Four LEDs connected to pins 0-3 shows single seconds, while
 *  three LEDs connected to pins 4-6 shows tens of seconds. The second counter
 *  wraps at 60, so it starts at 0 once every minute.
 *
 *  Hardware setup:
 *    - Connect LEDs to pins 0-6 on PORTD to watch the clock.
